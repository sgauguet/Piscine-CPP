Donald Trump
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current president of the United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality.

Trump was born and raised in the New York City borough of Queens and received an economics degree from the Wharton School. He was appointed president of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded it from Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, including licensing his name for real estate and consumer products. He managed the company until his 2017 inauguration. He co-authored several books, including The Art of the Deal. He owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and he produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality television show, from 2003 to 2015. Forbes estimates his net worth to be $3.1 billion.

Trump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. His campaign received extensive free media coverage. Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics. Trump was elected president in a surprise victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election while losing the popular vote.[b] His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Many of his comments and actions have been perceived as racially charged or racist.

During his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He enacted a tax cut package for individuals and businesses, which also rescinded the individual health insurance mandate and allowed oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge. He partially repealed the Dodd-Frank Act that had imposed stricter constraints on banks in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. He has pursued his America First agenda in foreign policy, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, imposed import tariffs on various goods, triggering a trade war with China, and negotiated with North Korea seeking denuclearization. He successfully nominated two justices to the Supreme Court: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

After Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, the Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel to proceed with investigating links between the Trump campaign and the Russian government regarding its election interference, and any matters arising from the probe. The ongoing investigation has led to guilty pleas by several Trump associates to criminal charges including lying to investigators, campaign finance violations, and tax fraud. Trump has repeatedly denied accusations of collusion and obstruction of justice, calling the investigation a politically motivated "witch hunt". In 2019, several House committees launched or expanded investigations of Trump's presidency, business, and personal life.

Family and personal life
Early life and education

Donald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital in the Queens borough of New York City.[1][2] His parents were Frederick Christ Trump, a real estate developer, and Mary Anne MacLeod.[3] Trump grew up in the Jamaica Estates neighborhood of Queens, and attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade.[4][5] At age 13, he was enrolled in the New York Military Academy,[6][7] a private boarding school, after his parents discovered that he had made frequent trips into Manhattan without their permission.[8][9] In 1964, Trump enrolled at Fordham University.[6][10] After two years, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[10][11] While at Wharton, he worked at the family business, Elizabeth Trump & Son.[12] He graduated in May 1968 with a B.S. in economics.[10][13][14]

While in college from 1964 to 1968, Trump obtained four student deferments from serving in the military.[15][16] In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a medical examination and in July 1968, after graduating from college, was briefly classified as eligible to serve by a local draft board. In October 1968, he was given a medical deferment which he later attributed to spurs in both heels, and classified as 1-Y: "Unqualified for duty except in the case of a national emergency."[17] In the December 1969 draft lottery, Trump's birthday, June 14, received a high number which would have given him a low probability to be called to military service even without the 1-Y.[17][18][19] In 1972, he was reclassified as 4-F, disqualifying him from service.[18][20]

The New York Times reported in 1973, and again in 1976, that Trump had graduated first in his class at Wharton. However, a 1984 Times profile of Trump noted he had never made honor roll. In 1988, New York magazine reported Trump conceding, "Okay, maybe not 'first,' as myth has it, but he had 'the highest grades possible.'"[21] Michael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, testified to the House Oversight Committee in February 2019 that Trump "directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores."[22] Days after Trump stated in 2011, "I heard [Barack Obama] was a terrible student, terrible. How does a bad student go to Columbia and then to Harvard?...Let him show his records,"[23] the headmaster of Trump's alma mater, New York Military Academy, was instructed by his manager to secure Trump's academic records so they could not be released, reportedly at the direction of "prominent, wealthy alumni of the school who were Mr. Trump’s friends”[24]

Ancestry and parents
Further information: Trump family

Trump's ancestors originated from the German village of Kallstadt in the Palatinate on his father's side, and from the Outer Hebrides in Scotland on his mother's side. All of his grandparents and his mother were born in Europe.[25]

Trump's paternal grandfather, Frederick Trump, first immigrated to the United States in 1885 at the age of 16 and became a citizen in 1892.[26] He amassed a fortune operating boomtown restaurants and boarding houses in the Seattle area and the Klondike region of Canada during its gold rush.[26] On a visit to Kallstadt, he met Elisabeth Christ and married her in 1902. The couple permanently settled in New York in 1905.[27] Frederick died from influenza during the 1918 pandemic.[28]

Trump's father Fred was born in 1905 in the Bronx. Fred started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15, shortly after his father's death. Their company, "E. Trump & Son",[c] founded in 1923,[33] was primarily active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. Fred eventually built and sold thousands of houses, barracks, and apartments.[28][34] In spite of his German ancestry, "Fred Trump sought to pass himself off as Swedish amid anti-German sentiment sparked by World War II."[35] Donald Trump "reaffirmed the myth" in The Art of the Deal.[35][36][37]

Trump's mother Mary Anne MacLeod was born in Tong, Lewis, Scotland. At age 18 in 1930, she immigrated to New York, where she worked as a maid.[38] Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens.[38][39] 

Trump grew up with three elder siblings—Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth—as well as a younger brother named Robert. Maryanne is an inactive Federal Appeals Court judge on the Third Circuit.[40]

Trump has five children by three marriages, as well as nine grandchildren.[41][42] In 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zelníčková at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, in a ceremony performed by the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale.[43][44] They had three children: Donald Jr. (born 1977), Ivanka (born 1981), and Eric (born 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[45] The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.[46] In October 1993, Maples gave birth to Trump's daughter, who was named Tiffany in honor of high-end retailer Tiffany & Company.[47] Maples and Trump were married two months later in December 1993.[48] They divorced in 1999,[49] and Tiffany was raised by Marla in California.[50]
Trump is sworn in as president on January 20, 2017. From left to right: Trump, his wife Melania, and his children Donald Jr., Barron, Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany.

Having first met in 1998,[51] Trump married his third wife, Slovenian model Melania Knauss, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2005.[52] In 2006, she gained United States citizenship[53] and gave birth to a son, Barron.[54][55] Melania became First Lady when Trump took office as president in January 2017.[56]

Upon his inauguration, Trump delegated the management of his real estate business to his two adult sons, Eric and Don Jr.[57] His daughter Ivanka resigned from the Trump Organization and moved to Washington, D.C., with her husband Jared Kushner. She serves as an assistant to the president,[58] and he is a Senior Advisor in the White House.[59] 

Religion

Trump is a Presbyterian.[60][61][62] His ancestors were Lutheran on his paternal grandfather's side in Germany[63] and Presbyterian on his mother's side in Scotland.[64] His parents married in a Manhattan Presbyterian church in 1936.[65] As a child, he attended the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, where he had his confirmation.[44] In the 1970s, his parents joined the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan,[66] part of the Reformed Church.[67] The pastor at Marble, Norman Vincent Peale, ministered to Trump's family and mentored him until Peale's death in 1993.[68][66] In August 2015 Trump told reporters, "I am Presbyterian Protestant. I go to Marble Collegiate Church," adding that he attends many different churches because he travels a lot.[69] The Marble Collegiate Church then issued a statement noting that Trump and his family have a "longstanding history" with the church, but that he "is not an active member".[67]

Trump said he was "not sure" whether he ever asked God for forgiveness, stating "If I do something wrong, I just try and make it right. I don't bring God into that picture." He said he tries to take Holy Communion as often as possible because it makes him "feel cleansed".[60] While campaigning, Trump referred to The Art of the Deal as his second favorite book after the Bible, saying, "Nothing beats the Bible."[70] The New York Times reported that evangelical Christians nationwide thought "that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure."[71]

Trump has associations with a number of Christian spiritual leaders, including Florida pastor Paula White, who has been called his "closest spiritual confidant."[72] In 2015, he released a list of religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed, Michele Bachmann, Robert Jeffress, and others.[73][74] 

Health
Main article: Health of Donald Trump

Trump does not drink alcohol, a reaction to his older brother Fred Trump Jr.'s alcoholism and early death.[75][76] He has stated that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed drugs, including marijuana.[77] In December 2015, Trump's personal physician, Harold Bornstein, released a superlative-laden letter of health which stated that Trump's "physical strength and stamina are extraordinary."[78][79] Bornstein later said that Trump himself had dictated the contents.[80] A follow-up medical report showed Trump's blood pressure, liver and thyroid functions to be in normal ranges, and that he takes a statin.[81][82] In January 2018, Trump was examined by White House physician Ronny Jackson, who stated that he was in excellent health and that his cardiac assessment revealed no medical issues,[83] although his weight and cholesterol level were higher than recommended.[84] Several outside cardiologists commented that Trump's weight, lifestyle, and LDL cholesterol level ought to have raised serious concerns about his cardiac health.[85] In February 2019, Trump underwent another physical examination; White House physician Sean Conley said Trump was in "very good health overall", although Trump had gained weight and was now clinically obese.[86]
Wealth
Main article: Wealth of Donald Trump

Trump was listed on the initial Forbes List of wealthy individuals in 1982 as having a share of his family's estimated $200 million net worth. His financial losses in the 1980s caused him to be dropped from the list between 1990 and 1995, and reportedly obliged him to borrow from his siblings' trusts in 1993.[87] In its 2019 billionaires ranking, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $3.1 billion[a] (715th in the world, 259th in the U.S.)[90] making him one of the richest politicians in American history and the first billionaire American president.[90] During the three years since Trump announced his presidential run in 2015, Forbes estimated his net worth declined 31% and his ranking fell 138 spots.[91] When he filed mandatory financial disclosure forms with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) in July 2015, Trump claimed a net worth of about $10 billion;[92] however FEC figures cannot corroborate this estimate because they only show each of his largest buildings as being worth over $50 million, yielding total assets worth more than $1.4 billion and debt over $265 million.[93] Trump reported hundreds of millions of dollars of yearly income from 2014 to 2018.[92][94][95] Trump stated in a 2007 deposition, "My net worth fluctuates, and it goes up and down with markets and with attitudes and with feelings, even my own feelings."[96]

Journalist Jonathan Greenberg reported in April 2018 that Trump, using a pseudonym "John Barron," called him in 1984 to falsely assert he then owned "in excess of 90 percent" of the Trump family's business in an effort to secure a higher ranking on the Forbes 400 list of wealthy Americans.[97]

Trump has often said that he began his career with "a small loan of one million dollars" from his father, and that he had to pay it back with interest.[98] In October 2018, The New York Times reported that Trump "was a millionaire by age 8", borrowed at least $60 million from his father, and largely failed to reimburse him, and had received $413 million (adjusted for inflation) from his father's business empire over his lifetime.[99][100] According to the report, Trump and his family committed tax fraud, which a lawyer for Trump denied; the tax department of New York says it is "vigorously pursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation" into it.[101][102] Analyses by The Economist and The Washington Post have concluded that Trump's investments have under-performed the stock market.[103][104] Forbes estimated in October 2018 that the value of Trump's personal brand licensing business had declined by 88% since 2015, to $3 million.[105]

Trump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, reinstatement of the Mexico City Policy, unlocking the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcing border security, and beginning the planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[510]

On January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat on the Supreme Court previous held by Justice Antonin Scalia until his death in 2016.[511]
Domestic policy
Economy and trade
Main articles: Economic policy of Donald Trump and Trump tariffs

In December 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, lowered personal tax brackets, increased child tax credit, doubled the estate tax threshold to $11.2 million, and limited the state and local tax deduction to $10,000.[512] The reduction in individual tax rates ends in 2025. While people would generally get a tax cut, those with higher incomes would see the most benefit.[513][514] Households in the lower or middle class would also see a small tax increase after the tax cuts expire. The bill is estimated to increase deficits by $1.5 trillion over 10 years.[515][516]
Trump speaking to automobile workers in Michigan, March 2017

Trump adopted his current views on trade issues in the 1980s.[517] Trump has been described as a protectionist[518][519][520] because he criticized NAFTA,[521][522] cancelled negotiations towards the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),[523] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum,[524][525] and proposed to significantly raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States.[526][527] He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted.[528][529]

In March 2018, Trump signed an order imposing import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, with exemptions for Canada, Mexico, and possibly other countries.[530] In response, the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs targeting $3.4 billion in U.S. exports.[531][532]

In July, the United States and China imposed tariffs on $34 billion of each other's goods,[533][534] expanded to $50 billion in August.[535]

In September the U.S. introduced a 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, poised to increase to 25% by the end of the year, and threatened further tariffs on an additional $267 billion if China retaliates.[536] China countered the move with a 10% tariff on $60 billion of U.S. imports,[537] which, combined with the previous round of tariffs, covers almost all $110 billion of U.S. imports to China.[536] According to some analysts, the escalating trade war with China[538] could impact $2 trillion in global trade.[539][540]
Energy and climate
Main article: Environmental policy under the Trump administration

While campaigning, Trump's energy policy advocated domestic support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter.[541] However, following his election his "America First Energy Plan" did not mention renewable energy and instead focused on fossil fuels.[542] Environmentalists expressed concerns after he announced plans to make large budget cuts to programs that research renewable energy and to roll back Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change and limiting environmental pollution.[543]

Trump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change[544][545] and his first Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, does not believe that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming. While acknowledging the climate is warming, Pruitt claimed this warming is not necessarily harmful and could be beneficial.[546] Based on numerous studies, climate experts disagree with his position.[547] On June 1, 2017, Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement.[548][549][550]
Government size and deregulation

Trump's early policies have favored rollback and dismantling of government regulations. He signed a Congressional Review Act disapproval resolution, the first in 16 years and second overall.[551] During his first six weeks in office, he delayed, suspended or reversed ninety federal regulations.[552][553]

On January 23, 2017, Trump ordered a temporary government-wide hiring freeze, except for those working in certain areas.[554][555] Unlike some past freezes, it barred agencies from adding contractors to make up for employees leaving.[556] The Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office told a House committee that hiring freezes have not proven to be effective in reducing costs.[556] The hiring freeze was lifted in April 2017.[557]

A week later Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed administrative agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation they issue.[558][559] Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump's criticisms, saying that the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups.[560]
Health care

In 1999, Trump told Larry King Live: "I believe in universal healthcare."[561] Trump's 2000 book, The America We Deserve, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model,[562] and he has voiced admiration for the Scottish National Health Service.[561][563][564]

During his campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA or "Obamacare").[565][566] Shortly after taking office, he urged Congress to repeal and replace it. In May of that year, the House of Representatives voted to repeal it.[567] Over the course of several months' effort, however, the Senate was unable to pass any version of a repeal bill.[568] Trump has expressed a desire to "let Obamacare fail", and the Trump administration has cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[569][570][571] The tax reform Trump signed into law at the end of his first year in office effectively repealed the individual health insurance mandate that was a major element of the Obamacare health insurance system; this repeal is scheduled to be implemented in 2019.[572][573][574]
Social issues
Main article: Social policy of Donald Trump

Trump favored modifying the 2016 Republican platform opposing abortion, to allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[575] He has said that he is committed to appointing pro-life justices.[576] He says he personally supports "traditional marriage"[577] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a "settled" issue.[576] Despite the statement by Trump and the White House saying they would keep in place a 2014 executive order from the Obama administration which created federal workplace protections for LGBT people,[578] in March 2017, the Trump administration rolled back key components of the Obama administration's workplace protections for LGBT people.[579]

Trump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[580][581] although his views have shifted over time.[582] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[583] He favors capital punishment,[584][585] as well as the use of waterboarding and "a hell of a lot worse" methods.[586][587]
Immigration
Main article: Immigration policy of Donald Trump

Trump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico–United States border to keep out illegal immigrants and vowed that Mexico would pay for it.[588] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[589] and criticized birthright citizenship for creating "anchor babies".[590] He said that deportation would focus on criminals, visa overstays, and security threats.[591]
Travel ban
Further information: Executive Order 13769 and Executive Order 13780

Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[592][593][594] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a "proven history of terrorism".[595][596][597]

On January 27, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order was imposed without warning and took effect immediately.[598] Confusion and protests caused chaos at airports.[599][600] The administration then clarified that visitors with a green card were exempt from the ban.[601][602]

On January 30, Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General, directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the executive order, which she deemed unenforceable and unconstitutional;[603] Trump immediately dismissed her.[604][605] Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and on February 5 a federal judge in Seattle blocked its implementation.[606][607] On March 6, Trump issued a revised order, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, and removed priorities for Christian minorities.[608][598] Again federal judges in three states blocked its implementation.[609] On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a "credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States."[610]

The temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea and Chad, and certain Venezuelan officials.[611] After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions with injunctions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4.[612] In January 2018, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a challenge to the travel ban.[613] The Court heard oral arguments on April 25,[614][613] and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June ruling.[615]
DACA

While running for president, Trump said that he intended to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) on "day one" of his presidency. The program, introduced in 2012, allowed people who had either entered or remained in the United States illegally as minors to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and be eligible for a work permit.[616]

In September 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the DACA program would be repealed after six months.[617] Trump argued that "top legal experts" believed that DACA was unconstitutional, and called on Congress to use the six-month delay to pass legislation solving the "Dreamers" issue permanently.[618] As of March 2018, when the delay expired, no legislation had been agreed on DACA.[619] Several states immediately challenged the DACA rescission in court.[620] Two injunctions in January and February 2018 allowed renewals of applications and stopped the rolling back of DACA, and in April 2018 a federal judge ordered the acceptance of new applications; this would go into effect in 90 days.[621]
Family separation at border
Main article: Trump administration family separation policy

In April 2018, Trump enacted a "zero tolerance" immigration policy that took adults irregularly entering the U.S. into custody for criminal prosecution and forcibly separated children from parents, eliminating the policy of previous administrations that made exceptions for families with children.[622][623] By mid-June, more than 2,300 children had been placed in shelters, including "tender age" shelters for babies and toddlers,[624] culminating in demands from Democrats, Republicans, Trump allies, and religious groups that the policy be rescinded.[625] Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law.[626][627][628] On June 20, Trump signed an executive order to end family separations at the U.S. border.[629] On June 26 a federal judge in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Trump administration to stop detaining immigrants parents separately from their minor children, and to reunite family groups that had been separated at the border.[630]
2018–2019 federal government shutdown
Main article: United States federal government shutdown of 2018–2019

On December 22, 2018, the federal government was partially shut down after Trump declared that any funding extension must include $5.6 billion in federal funds for a U.S.–Mexico border wall to partly fulfill his campaign promise.[631] The shutdown was caused by a lapse in funding for nine federal departments, affecting about one-fourth of federal government activities.[632] Trump said he would not accept any bill that does not include funding for the wall, and Democrats, who control the House, said they would not support any bill that does. Senate Republicans have said they will not advance any legislation that Trump would not sign.[633] In earlier negotiations with Democratic leaders, Trump commented that he would be "proud to shut down the government for border security".[634][635][636]

On January 25, 2019, Congress passed and Trump signed a 3-week appropriation bill to fund the government while negotiations on border security funding take place.[637] This ended the 31-day shutdown, the longest such shutdown in U.S. history.[638] On February 14 both houses of Congress passed, and on February 15 Trump signed, a bill to fund the government until September 30, the balance of the fiscal year. At the same time he signed a declaration that there is a national emergency at the country's southern border, ordering that funds from drug interdiction programs and military construction projects be used to build barriers along the border.[639] On March 5, 2019, it was admitted by a senior republican member of Senate that Trump’s declaration of emergency would be rejected by the Senate.[640]

Trump has been described as a non-interventionist[641][642] and as an American nationalist.[643] He has repeatedly stated that he supports an "America First" foreign policy.[644] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[643] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[645] He says America should look inward, stop "nation building", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[642] Trump has praised China's president Xi Jinping,[646] Philippines president Rodrigo Duterte,[647] Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,[648] Turkey's president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan,[649] King Salman of Saudi Arabia,[650] Italy's prime minister Giuseppe Conte[651] and Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro.[652] Trump also praised Poland under the EU-skeptic, anti-immigrant Law and Justice party (PiS) as a defender of Western civilization.[653][654]
ISIS and foreign wars

In order to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), in 2015 Trump called for seizing the oil in ISIS-occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops.[655] In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region, a position he later retracted.[656][657]

In April 2017, Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian airfield in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[658] According to investigative journalist Bob Woodward, Trump had ordered his Defense Secretary James Mattis to assassinate Syrian president Bashar al-Assad after the chemical attack, but Mattis declined; Trump denied doing so.[659] In April 2018, he announced missile strikes against Assad's regime, following a suspected chemical attack near Damascus.[660]

In December 2018, Trump declared "we have won against ISIS," and ordered the withdrawal of all troops from Syria, contradicting Department of Defense assessments.[661][662][663] Mattis resigned the next day over disagreements in foreign policy, calling this decision an abandonment of Kurd allies that had played a key role in fighting ISIS.[664] One week after his announcement, Trump asserted he would not approve any extension of the American deployment in Syria.[665] On January 6, 2019, national security advisor John Bolton announced America would remain in Syria until ISIS is eradicated and Turkey guaranteed it would not strike America's Kurdish allies.[666]

Trump actively supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Houthis and signed a $110 billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.[667][668][669] Trump also praised his relationship with Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.[667]

U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 to 14,000, as of January 2017.[670] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[671] U.S. officials said then that they aimed to "force the Taliban to negotiate a political settlement"; in January 2018, however, Trump spoke against talks with the Taliban.[672]
Iran
Main articles: Iran–United States relations § 2017–present: Trump administration, and United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action

Trump has described the regime in Iran as "the rogue regime".[673] He has repeatedly criticized the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or "Iran nuclear deal") that was negotiated with the United States, Iran, and five other world powers in 2015, calling it "terrible" and saying that the Obama administration negotiated the agreement "from desperation."[674][675] At one point Trump said that despite opposing the content of the deal, he would attempt to enforce it rather than abrogate it.[676]
Protest against Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as capital of Israel, Tehran, December 11, 2017

Following Iran's ballistic missile tests on January 29, 2017, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on 25 Iranian individuals and entities in February 2017.[677][678][679] Trump reportedly lobbied "dozens" of European officials against doing business with Iran during the May 2017 Brussels summit; this likely violated the terms of the JCPOA, under which the U.S. may not pursue "any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran." The Trump administration certified in July 2017 that Iran had upheld its end of the agreement.[680] On May 18, 2018, Trump announced the United States' unilateral departure from the JCPOA.[675]
Israel
Trump and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu at Yad Vashem, May 2017

Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is "a big fan of Israel".[681] During the campaign he said he would relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from its current location, Tel Aviv.[682] On May 22, 2017, Trump was the first U.S. president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem, during his first foreign trip, which included Israel, Italy, the Vatican, and Belgium.[683][684] Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on December 6, 2017, despite criticism and warnings from world leaders. Trump added that he would initiate the process of establishing a new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem,[685] which was later opened on May 14, 2018.[686] The United Nations General Assembly condemned the move, adopting a resolution that "calls upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem" in an emergency session on December 21, 2017.[687][688]
Venezuela

On August 11, 2017, Trump said that he is "not going to rule out a military option" to confront the government of Nicolás Maduro.[689] In September 2018, Trump called "for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela" and said that "socialism has bankrupted the oil-rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty."[690] On January 23, 2019, Maduro announced that Venezuela was breaking ties with the United States following Trump's announcement of recognizing Juan Guaidó, the Venezuelan opposition leader, as the interim president of Venezuela.[691]
North Korea
Trump meets Kim Jong-un at the Singapore summit in June 2018.

During the campaign and the early months of his presidency, Trump said he hoped that China would help to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions and missile tests.[692] However, North Korea accelerated their missile and nuclear tests leading to increased tension.[692] In July, the country tested two long-range missiles identified by Western observers as intercontinental ballistic missiles, potentially capable of reaching Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland.[693][694] In August, Trump dramatically escalated his rhetoric against North Korea, warning that further provocation against the U.S. would be met with "fire and fury like the world has never seen."[695] North Korean leader Kim Jong-un then threatened to direct the country's next missile test toward Guam.[696]

On June 12, 2018, after several rounds of preliminary staff-level meetings, Trump and Kim held a first nuclear summit.[697] In a joint declaration, both countries vowed to "join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula", while North Korea repeated its April 2018 promise to "work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."[698][699] Six months later, North Korea said they would not cease their nuclear weapons program until the U.S. removes its nuclear threat from the Korean peninsula and "all neighboring areas".[700][701]

A second nuclear summit, announced by Trump in his 2019 State of the Union Address,[702] took place from February 27–28, 2019, in Vietnam's capital Hanoi.[703] It ended abruptly without an agreement, with both sides blaming each other and offering differing accounts of the negotiations.[703][704][705]
Russia

During his campaign and as president, Trump repeatedly said that he wants better relations with Russia,[706][707] and he has praised Russian president Vladimir Putin as a strong leader.[708][709] Trump had pledged to hold a summit meeting with Putin,[710] stating that Russia could help the U.S. in fighting ISIS.[711] According to Putin and some political experts and diplomats, the U.S.–Russian relations, which were already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War, have further deteriorated since Trump took office in January 2017.[712][713][714]

Trump and Putin met in a 2018 Russia–United States summit in Helsinki on July 16, 2018. Trump drew harsh bipartisan criticism in the United States for appearing to side with Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of the United States intelligence community.[715][716] His comments were strongly criticized by many congressional Republicans and most media commentators, even those who normally support him.[717][718]
Cuba

In November 2017, the Trump administration tightened the rules on trade with Cuba and individual visits to the county, undoing the Obama administration's loosening of restrictions. According to an administration official, the new rules were intended to hinder trade with businesses with ties to the Cuban military, intelligence and security services.[719]
NATO

As a candidate, Trump questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[720] and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[721] As president, he reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to NATO in March 2017.[722] However, he has repeatedly accused fellow NATO members of paying less than their fair share of the expenses of the alliance.[723]

In January 2019 The New York Times quoted senior administration officials as saying that Trump has privately suggested on multiple occasions that the United States should withdraw from NATO.[724] The next day Trump said the United States is going to "be with NATO 100 percent" but repeated that the other countries have to "step up" and pay more.[725]
Personnel

The Trump administration has been characterized by high turnover, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[726] As of early July 2018, 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[727] and 141 staffers had left in the past year.[728] Both figures set a record for recent presidents—more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[729] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Mike Flynn (after just 25 days in office), Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, replaced by retired Marine General John F. Kelly on July 28, 2017,[730] and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[729] Close personal aides to Trump such as Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee and Keith Schiller, have quit or been forced out.[731]

Trump has been slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying that many of the positions are unnecessary. As of October 2017, there were hundreds of sub-cabinet positions without a nominee.[732] By January 8, 2019, of 706 key positions, 433 had been filled and Trump had no nominee for 264.[733]
Cabinet

Cabinet meeting, March 2017

Trump's cabinet nominations included U.S. Senator from Alabama Jeff Sessions as Attorney General,[734] financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury,[735] retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense,[736] and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.[737] Trump also brought on board politicians who had opposed him during the presidential campaign, such as neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[738] and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations.[739]

Two of Trump's 15 original cabinet members were gone within 15 months: Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft, and Trump replaced Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo in March 2018 over disagreements on foreign policy.[740][731] EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in July 2018 amidst multiple investigations into his conduct,[741] while Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke resigned five months later as he also faced multiple investigations.[742]
Investigations
Further information: Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (2017), Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (2018), and Timeline of investigations into Trump and Russia (2019)

An FBI investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign was launched in mid-2016 during the campaign season. Since he assumed the presidency, Trump has been the subject of increasing Justice Department and congressional scrutiny, with investigations covering his election campaign, transition and inauguration, actions taken during his presidency, along with his private businesses, personal taxes, and charitable foundation.[102]
Russian interference
Main articles: Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, Timeline of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, and Links between Trump associates and Russian officials

In January 2017, American intelligence agencies—the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence—jointly stated with "high confidence" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[743][744] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that "the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts."[745] Later, in testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, he affirmed he has "no doubt" that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, adding "they did it with purpose and sophistication".[746]

Trump's connections to Russia have been widely reported by the press.[747][748] One of Trump's campaign managers, Paul Manafort, had worked for several years to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovych win the Ukrainian presidency.[749] Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, have been connected to Russian officials.[750][751] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[752] Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[753] On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that had been imposed the same day; Trump later fired Flynn for falsely claiming he had not discussed the sanctions.[754]
Dismissal of James Comey

On May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey. He first attributed this action to recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein,[755] which criticized Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails.[756] On May 11, Trump stated that he was concerned with the ongoing "Russia thing"[757] and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier, regardless of DoJ advice.[758]

According to a Comey memo of a private conversation on February 14, 2017, Trump said he "hoped" Comey would drop the investigation into Michael Flynn.[759] In March and April, Trump had told Comey that the ongoing suspicions formed a "cloud" impairing his presidency,[760] and asked him to publicly state that he was not personally under investigation.[761] He also asked intelligence chiefs Dan Coats and Michael Rogers to issue statements saying there was no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.[762] Both refused, considering this an inappropriate request, although not illegal.[763] Comey eventually testified on June 8 that while he was director, the FBI investigations did not target Trump himself.[760][764] In a statement on Twitter, Trump implied that he had "tapes" of conversations with Comey, before later stating that he did not in fact have such tapes.[765]
Special counsel

On May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former Director of the FBI, to serve as special counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). In this capacity, Mueller oversees the investigation into "any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation".[766] Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.[767] Mueller is also investigating the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.[768][769]

The Washington Post reported that days after Comey's dismissal the special counsel started investigating whether Trump had obstructed justice.[770] Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow stated that he had not been notified of any such investigation.[771][772] ABC News later reported that the special counsel was gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice but had not launched a full-scale investigation.[773]

In January 2018, The New York Times reported that Trump had ordered Mueller to be fired in June 2017, after learning that Mueller was investigating possible obstruction of justice, but backed down after White House Counsel Don McGahn said he would quit;[774] Trump called the report "fake news".[775] The New York Times reported in April 2018 that Trump had again wanted the investigation shut down in early December 2017, but stopped after learning the news reports on which he based his decision were incorrect.[776] In April 2018, following an FBI raid on the office and home of Trump's private attorney Michael Cohen, Trump mused aloud about firing Mueller.[777] In August 2018, Trump wrote that Attorney General Jeff Sessions "should stop" the special counsel investigation "right now"; he also referred to it as a "rigged witch hunt".[778]

In January 2018 it was reported that Mueller wants to interview Trump about the removal of Flynn and Comey.[779] For most of 2018 there was discussion between Mueller's office and White House attorneys about whether Trump would give Mueller an in-person interview or written answers to questions, and what subjects would be covered. Trump himself said publicly he was willing to be interviewed.[780] In November 2018 he said he was preparing written answers to a set of questions, and in late November his legal team said he had submitted answers to the counsel's written questions about "issues regarding the Russia-related topics of the inquiry."[781]

The New York Times reported on January 11, 2019, that FBI counterintelligence grew concerned about Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 campaign but held off opening an investigation because of uncertainty about how to proceed on such a sensitive matter. Trump's behavior during the days immediately before and after Comey's firing caused them to begin investigating whether Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests, knowingly or unknowingly. The FBI merged that counterintelligence investigation with a criminal obstruction of justice investigation related to Comey's firing. Mueller took over that investigation upon his appointment, although it was not immediately clear if he had pursued the counterintelligence angle.[782]

As of February 2019, Trump has publicly criticized people or groups related to the investigations into links between Trump associates and Russia over 1,000 times during his presidency.[783]
Associates

On August 21, 2018, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was convicted on eight felony counts of false tax filing and bank fraud.[784] Trump said he felt very badly for Manafort and praised him for resisting the pressure to make a deal with prosecutors, saying "Such respect for a brave man!" According to Giuliani, Trump had sought advice about pardoning Manafort but was counseled against it.[785]

In September Manafort faced a second trial on multiple charges, but reached a plea bargain under which he pleaded guilty to conspiracy and witness tampering and agreed to cooperate fully with investigators.[786] In November, Mueller's office said in a court filing that Manafort had repeatedly lied to investigators, thus violating the terms of the plea agreement.[787] It was also revealed that Manafort, through his attorney, had been briefing White House attorneys about his interactions with the special counsel's office.[788] Trump publicly hinted that he might pardon Manafort,[789] but the incoming chair of the House Judiciary Committee warned that "dangling a pardon in front of Manafort" could lead to charges of obstruction of justice.[790]

On November 29, Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about Trump's 2016 attempts to reach a deal with Russia to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Cohen said that he had made the false statements on behalf of Trump, who was identified as "Individual-1" in the court documents.[791]

The five Trump associates who have pleaded guilty or have been convicted in Mueller's investigation or related cases include Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen. The charges against them were not related to collusion with Russia.[792] On January 25, 2019, Trump adviser Roger Stone was arrested at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and indicted on seven criminal charges.[793]
Hush payments

Adult film actress Stormy Daniels has alleged that she and Trump had an affair in 2006,[794] which Trump denied.[795] In January 2018, it was reported that just before the 2016 presidential election Daniels was paid $130,000 by Trump's attorney Michael Cohen as part of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA); Cohen later said he paid her with his own money.[796] In February 2018, Daniels sued Cohen's company asking to be released from the NDA and be allowed to tell her story. Cohen obtained a restraining order to keep her from discussing the case.[797][798] In March, Daniels claimed in court that the NDA never came into effect because Trump did not sign it personally.[799]

In April 2018, Trump said that he did not know about Cohen paying Daniels, why Cohen had made the payment or where Cohen got the money from.[800] In May, Trump's annual financial disclosure revealed that he reimbursed Cohen in 2017 for payments related to Daniels.[801] In August 2018, in a case brought by the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York,[802] Cohen pleaded guilty in federal court to breaking campaign finance laws, admitting to paying hush money of $130,000 to Daniels and $150,000 indirectly to Playboy model Karen McDougal, and said that he did it at the direction of Trump,[803][804] with the aim of influencing the presidential election.[805] In response, Trump said that he only knew about the payments "later on", and that he paid back Cohen personally, not out of campaign funds.[806] Cohen also said he would cooperate fully with the special counsel investigation.[807]

In a December 7, 2018 sentencing memorandum for Cohen, federal prosecutors implicated Trump in directing Cohen to commit the campaign finance law felonies for which Cohen had pleaded guilty. Shortly after the memorandum court filing, Trump tweeted, "Totally clears the president. Thank you!"[808] Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison, stemming from his guilty pleas to five counts of tax evasion and one count each of excessive campaign contribution, unlawful corporate contribution and false statements to a bank.[809] Trump denied directing Cohen to make the payments.[810] That same day, NBC News reported that Trump was present in an August 2015 meeting with Cohen and David Pecker when they discussed how American Media could help counter negative stories about Trump's relationships with women, confirming previous reporting by The Wall Street Journal.[811]
2019 House investigation

In March 2019 the House Judiciary Committee launched a broad investigation of Trump for possible obstruction of justice, corruption, and abuse of power.[812] The Judiciary Committee chair Jerrold Nadler sent letters demanding documents to 81 individuals and organizations associated with both Trump’s presidency, business, and private life, saying it's "very clear that the president obstructed justice."[813][814] Three other committee chairmen wrote the White House and State Department requesting details of Trump’s communications with Putin, including any efforts to conceal the content of those communications.[815] According to Senator Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, there is "enormous" evidence of the Trump campaign's involvement with Russia. Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, stated that there is "direct evidence" of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.[816][817]
Impeachment efforts

Congressman Al Green delivers a speech calling for impeachment of President Trump, June 2017

Formal efforts to start the process of impeachment against Trump, who took office in January 2017, have been initiated by Representatives Al Green and Brad Sherman, both Democrats.[818][819] Other people and groups have asserted that Trump has engaged in impeachable activity during his presidency.[820][821] Talk of impeachment began before Trump took office.[822][823]

Serious proposals to impeach Trump for obstruction of justice were made in May 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey[824][825][826] and allegations surfaced that Trump had asked Comey to drop the investigation against Michael Flynn.[827] A December 2017 resolution of impeachment failed in the House by a 58–364 margin.[828] Since the Republicans controlled the Senate, the likelihood of impeachment during the 2017–2019 115th Congress was considered remote.[829][830]

Independently of impeachment, some commentators have speculated that Trump could be stripped of his powers and duties for incapacity under the 25th Amendment of the Constitution.[831][832]
2020 presidential campaign

Trump signaled his intention to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within hours of assuming the presidency.[833] This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one.[834] Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a rally in Melbourne, Florida, on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office.[835] By January 2018, Trump's reelection committee had $22 million in hand,[836] and it had raised a total amount exceeding $67 million as of December 2018.[837] $23 million were spent in the fourth quarter of 2018, as Trump supported various Republican candidates for the 2018 midterm elections.[838]
